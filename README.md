## FastAPI Basics

This repository contains a collection of very elementary FastAPI code snippets meant for basic learning and experimentation. If you’re new to FastAPI, these examples serve as a great starting point.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It’s designed to be easy to use while providing powerful features for building production-ready APIs.

For setup and usage instructions, please refer to the *“Steps for FastAPI.docx”* file included in this repository.
